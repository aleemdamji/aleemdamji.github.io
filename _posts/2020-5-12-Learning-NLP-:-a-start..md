My current project is working through Bird et al.'s [Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.nltk.org/book/) book. My current plan is to work through all twelve chapters, with the goal of creating something cool after I finish the book! :smiley: I will be posting my progress in [this repository](https://github.com/aleemdamji/LearningNLP).
