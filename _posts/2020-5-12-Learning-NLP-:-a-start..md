title:  "Learning NLP: A Start"

My current project is working through Bird et al.'s [Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.nltk.org/book/) book. My current plan is to work through all twelve chapters, with the goal of creating something cool after I finish the book! I will be posting my progress in [this repository](https://github.com/aleemdamji/LearningNLP).
